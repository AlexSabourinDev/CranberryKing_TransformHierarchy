# CranberryKing_TransformHierarchy

This repo attempts to answer the question of the most "effective" approach to implementing a transform hierarchy.

An implementation will be deemed "effective" if it is:
- Fast
- Not overly limiting

Some potential options for the hierarchy are:
- Multithreading?
- Dirty matrices?
- Data oriented design?

The goal is not to have a complete library that someone could implement into their engine, but moreso an answer to what an effective implementation could be. (Although, if you want to try to plug it into your engine, go ahea!)
